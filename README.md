# About this Game

This game is a incomplete part of a bigger game, made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI9idPTT0c4&t=5s">Chris Courses</a>. In his 2 hour tutorial, he coded a simple spaceship shooter game using only Canvas and Javascript.

No need to install anything, to download anything. Just get a copy of this code on your computer, open the html file in a browser and play it.

It looks nice, and can be improved a lot. Chris does have a 5 hour long course, where he keeps adding functionalities to this game, the final project looks amazing. Check it out here: https://chriscourses.com/game-course.
